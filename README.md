# Bank-loan-analysis
## Data Overview:
The data corresponding to the project deals with the personal details, professional and credential background of the customers of the bank.The dataset has two files finance_1 & finance_2. The both files has 39 thousand records and a common column id.
## Objectives:
The main goal was to take a handful of important performance metrics (KPIs) and turn them into easy-to-understand visualizations. The aim was to create clear charts and graphs that not only tackled the specific KPIs given but also made it simple for everyone to grasp how the company was doing. This objective pushed me to enhance my data analysis skills and communicate insights visually, helping to make better-informed decisions based on the data.
## KPIâ€™s:

- Year wise loan amount stats

- Grade and subgrade wise revol_bal

- Total Payment for Verified Status Vs Total Payment for Non-Verified Status

- State wise and last_credit_pull_d wise loan status

- Home ownership Vs last payment date stats
